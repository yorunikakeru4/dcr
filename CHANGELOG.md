# Changelog

## [0.6.7] - 2026-05-26

Added:

- `build.kind = "efi"` — UEFI PE32+ executable support. Links with `-shared -nostdlib -Wl,-dll -Wl,--subsystem,10`, output via `efi_path()` with `.efi` extension, rejected by `dcr run`.
- `build.kind = "elf"` — bare-metal ELF executable support. Uses `elf_path()` output path, rejected by `dcr run`, no extra linker flags.
- `build.filename` and `build.extension` in `dcr.toml` — complete control over the final artifact name without relying on `package.name`.
  Example:

  ```toml
  [build]
  filename = "KERNEL"
  extension = "EFI"
  ```

  Produces `KERNEL.EFI` (works for `bin`, `staticlib`, and `sharedlib`).
- Automatic injection of `--target=<build.target>` into compiler flags when `build.target` is set in `dcr.toml`. This greatly simplifies clang-based cross-compilation (especially for bare-metal targets like `aarch64-none-elf`).
- Bare-metal targets (containing `none`, `-elf`, `eabi`, `baremetal`) no longer receive DCR's internal default flags (`-g`, `-Wall`, `-Wextra`, `-fno-omit-frame-pointer`, `-DDCR_DEBUG`, etc.). Prevents unwanted sections (`.comment`, debug info, etc.) that break custom linker scripts when `inherit = true`.
- `build.ldscript` in `dcr.toml` — linker script path passed as `-T <path>` to the linker. Essential for bare-metal/embedded/freestanding targets.
- `dcr build --verbose` — prints compiler/linker command lines (also works with `DCR_DEBUG` env var).
- `dcr add <name>` without a source argument — if a registry is configured, DCR looks up the package by name and adds it as a version dependency.

Fixed:

- `build.target` declared in `dcr.toml` is now correctly used as the default target even when `--target` is not passed on the command line (previously the host target was always forced for config resolution).
- `dcr run` with `--target` or `build.target` now correctly finds the binary in the arch-specific target directory.
- `dcr run` checks profile-specific `build.{profile}.kind` before rejecting library builds (previously only checked `build.kind`).
- `dcr clean` now reads `build.target` from `dcr.toml` when no `--target` flag is given.
- Linux: target directory is now consistent — `target/<arch>-unknown-linux-gnu/<profile>/` (no stale `target/<profile>/`).
- `dcr.lock` is now populated with all resolved dependencies (registry, path, git) instead of being always empty.
- Git dependencies are now properly recognized and recorded in `dcr.lock`.
- `is_registry_dep` correctly identifies version-based registry dependency tables (`{ version = "..." }`) and rejects tables with unknown keys.
- `dcr test` accepts `--debug`/`--release` flags (defaults to `debug` profile instead of always `release`).
- Build fingerprint cache (`build_cache_path`) now includes `target_dir` — different targets no longer share a single cache entry.
- `object_path` no longer hardcodes the `src/` prefix — works correctly with custom `build.roots` (e.g. `roots = ["lib"]`).
- `dcr update` now generates `.exe` candidates for all Windows targets, not just `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`.
- Compiler existence is verified before starting the build (clear error if compiler is not found in PATH).
- Consolidated duplicate `OUTPUT_MUTEX` definitions — MSVC backend now uses the shared mutex from `common.rs`.
- Registry cache root directory is created if missing (prevents cryptic errors when `~/.dcr/` does not exist).

Changed:

- `openssl` dependency is now conditional (`cfg(not(windows))`) — no longer pulled in on Windows, fixing Windows CI builds that lack Perl `Locale::Maketext::Simple`. On Linux (including musl cross-compilation) the vendored OpenSSL build is unchanged.

## [0.6.6] - 2026-05-18

Fixed:

- Path dependencies now work correctly: `dcr add` stores them as `{ path =
"./..." }` tables, `is_registry_dep` properly distinguishes registry strings
from path/git strings, and `deps/mod.rs` resolves both table-form and
legacy string-form path dependencies
- Registry dependency paths no longer hardcoded to `project_root/dcr-index`;
now use `package_root_from_registry_info()` which resolves relative to the
registry cache root (`~/.dcr/`)
- Registry dependencies are now actually built: `build_project_at()` is
called when `include_dir` or `lib_dir` is missing

Added:

- `SIGINT`/`Ctrl+C` handler via `ctrlc` crate — `dcr build` now checks
`BUILD_INTERRUPTED` flag at key points and aborts cleanly
- `utils/build.rs` — extracted shared utilities: `parse_version_info`,
`normalize_target_os`, `resolve_compiler`, `primary_language`,
`resolve_pkg_config_flags` and config helpers. Eliminates code duplication
between `cli/build.rs`, `cli/run.rs`, `cli/clean.rs`, `cli/gen.rs`
- `utils/fs.rs::with_dir` — extracted common directory-scoped execution
- `run_command_sync_output` in `builder/common.rs` with global `OUTPUT_MUTEX`
— synchronized compiler output across all backends (unix_cc, gas, nasm, msvc)
- New helper functions in `deps/register.rs`: `get_registry_cache_root`,
`package_root_from_registry_info`, `registry_include_dir`, `registry_lib_dir`,
`path_from_string_dep`
- Unit tests for `register.rs` (`is_registry_dep`, `package_root_from_registry_info`),
  `deps/mod.rs` (`path_dep_path`, `push_default_lib_dirs`),
  `utils/build.rs` (`normalize_target_os`, `parse_version_info`)
- `dcr tree` command — visual dependency tree viewer (similar to `cargo tree`)
